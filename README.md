# Frontend for Class-Bingo project

Built with React.js using Material UI components

**Functionality**

Includes functionality for:

- Login/Logout
- Session management
- Creating tiles and board
- Playing Binog (of course)
- and more!

**Status: Deprecated**

Connected API has been deprecated. Supabase was used to host the database, but their connection method was changed from IPv4 to IPv6, and stopped support of direct database connection.

For a version of the app that "works" without the API, check the branch "test_branch".
